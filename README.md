# twyg â€“ Generative tree visualiser for Python

**twyg** lets you visualise arbitrary tree structures in a pretty way.  The
appearance of the tree (layout, color, node and connection shapes etc.) is
fully controlled via configuration files in a programmatic way. Comes with an
extensive set of default configurations and colorschemes. Requires Cairo (and
optionally PIL) for image generation when used from the command-line or can be
used as a NodeBox1 library.


## Main Features

* Simple yet flexible configuration language to fully control all visual
  aspects of the tree
* Customisable layout and coloring algorithms
* Lots of fully customisable node and connections shapes
* Built-in configurations and colorschemes
* Tree structures are described in simple JSON files
* Can be used from the command-line with the Cairo backend or as a NodeBox1
  library
* PDF, SVG and PNG output formats
* Optionally requires PIL for drop-shadow support
* Python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 support
* Extensive documentation
