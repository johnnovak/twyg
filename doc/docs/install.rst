Installation
============


Prerequisites
-------------

Automatic installation
----------------------

**twyg** is registered at the Python Package Index (PyPI), so the simplest way
to install it is with the ``pip`` command:

.. code:: bash

    pip install twyg

That's it.

.. note:: The installation package contains example data files and some useful
  scripts which won't be installed by using this method. You might want to
  download the package as well to get those files.

Manual installation
-------------------

You can also download the installation package at PyPi and then install
manually:

.. code:: bash

    tar xvzf tywg-0.1.tar.gz
    cd tornado-0.1
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install
