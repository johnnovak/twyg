  <p> Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
  documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD
  license.</p>

  <p>It was originally created for <a href="http://docs.python.org/">the new
      Python documentation</a>, and it has excellent facilities for the
  documentation of Python projects, but C/C++ is already supported as well, and
  it is planned to add special support for other languages as well.  Of course,
  this site is also created from reStructuredText sources using Sphinx!  The
  following features should be highlighted:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Output formats:</b> HTML (including Windows HTML Help), LaTeX (for
      printable PDF versions), Texinfo, manual pages, plain text</li>
    <li><b>Extensive cross-references:</b> semantic markup and automatic links
      for functions, classes, citations, glossary terms and similar pieces of
      information</li>
  </ul>
