  <h1>Quickstart</h1>

  <p><em>twyg</em> expects plain-text <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>
  files as input that describe the tree to be drawn. These JSON files only
  contain the <em>topology</em> of the tree and the <em>text labels</em> of the
  individual tree nodes. They do not contain any information on <em>how</em> the
  tree should be visually rendered.</p>

  <p>The visual appearance of the tree is described in so-called
  <em>configuration files</em>. Several <a href="../examples/">built-in
    configurations</a> are included
  with your twyg installation that you can use out-of-the-box. That way, you
  don't need to learn the intricacies of the custom <a
    href="../docs/config/">configuration language</a> to
  get pretty looking results quickly.</p>

  <p>The benefit of separating the visual style from the tree data itself is
  that this way you can easily render the same tree in different visual styles
  by just using a different configuration file. Moreover, configurations can
  defined in a generative manner, which means that almost all <a
    href="../docs/reference/">visual aspects</a>
  of the tree can be defined as expressions that depend on the tree's
  properties (e.g. the color or shape of a node can depend on the hierarchical
  position it occupies in the tree).  This allows for crafting very flexible
  configurations that can be applied to trees of arbitrary size and
  complexity.</p>

  <p>Below is a sample JSON file and the corresponding graph that was
  generated using the default configuration:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
  {
      "Animals": [
          {"Birds": [
              "Parrots",
              "Owls",
              "Penguis"
          ]},
          {"Mammals": [
              {"Primates":
                  "Harry the Monkey"
              },
              "Rodents"
          ]},
          "Fish",
          "Invertebrates"
  }</pre>

    <img src="{{ pathto('_static/quickstart-animals.png', 1) }}" alt="Animals" />
  </div>

  <p>To generate this graph as a PDF file, create a text file
  <code>example.json</code> containing the JSON data above and then execute
  this command:</p>

  <pre>twyg.py example.json example.pdf</pre>

  <p>You can also specify the <em>configuration</em> and <em>colorscheme</em> to
  use as shown below (see the <a href="../examples/">examples page</a> for
  samples of the built-in colorschemes and configurations). The <em>output
  format</em> is determined by the extension of the output file, which in this
  case will be PNG:</p>

  <pre>$ twyg.py --config nazca --colorscheme azure example.json example.png</pre>

  <img class="img" src="{{ pathto('_static/quickstart-animals2.png', 1) }}" alt="Animals" />

  <p>Refer to the <a href="../docs/">documentation</a> for a full description
  of all available <a href="../docs/usage/#command-line-interface">command
  line options</a> and to learn how to create your own custom <a
  href="../docs/config/">configurations</a>.</p>
