***********************************************
twyg â€“ Scriptable tree visualisation for Python
***********************************************

**twyg** lets you visualise arbitrary tree structures in a pretty way.  The
appearance of the tree (layout, color, node and connection shapes etc.) is
fully controlled via configuration files in a programmatic way. Comes with an
extensive set of default configurations and colorschemes. Requires Cairo (and
optionally PIL) for image generation when used from the command-line or can be
used as a NodeBox1 library.
