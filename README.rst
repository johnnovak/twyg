***********************************************
twyg â€“ Scriptable tree visualisation for Python
***********************************************

**twyg** lets you visualise arbitrary tree structures in a pretty way.  The
appearance of the tree (layout, color, node and connection shapes etc.) are
fully controlled via configuration files in a programmatic way. Comes with an
extensive set of pre-built configurations and colorschemes. Requires Cairo for
image generation when used from the command line or can be used as a NodeBox1
library.
